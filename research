# Research_Update : Psychogravitronics, Oneironautics and Synergistic Intuitives

With regards the phenomenon, I don't like the vision of the space as a help group or something like AA, even though I respect it. There are plenty of people who are finding the information and gathering the data to be squawked at on Twitter; but lets face it, pioneers such as Jacques Vallee and Gary Nolan are getting old. To make matters worse, we have no real philosophers in the age of the Internet. Those who are likely on the path to understanding (enter Tom Campbell or the late Bob Monroe, rest his innovative soul) tolerate simple explanations, forgetting that Humans are just as destructive as they are innovative. 

There needs to be a proverbial passing of the torch and the most important aspect of this is that of learning something about ourselves as well as engaging with the possibilities of what this *can* be and how to use it to minimize future suffering and destruction. This is why most of my research is supported by the interesting aspects of the researchers who come before, but most importantly it is not withheld from you as the reader. I hope there are as many engineers, hackers, and writers here as there are meditators and spiritual seekers. Whether this is all simply science fiction or the as yet untold mythology of our descendants, I find that the important aspect is that we remind those to come that we considered their problems and proposed solutions.

I believe there are three fundamental advancements looming for Humans which focus centrally on consciousness. The first is what I am for now calling the *Intuition Synchronicity* (Synergistic Intuitives; the discovery and development of a field bridging psychology and materials science that instigates the discardment of Artificial Intelligence). Secondly, is the combination of organic systems that will usher in the next phase of communications and organism collaboration (Psychogravitronics). This will conceivably lead Humans to abandon materials science altogether. Finally in both gravitas of influence and likely chronological position, is the leap to what we can only loosely understand as “interdimensional” travel, but more accurately an *Escape Velocity,* or the ability not to simply achieve immortality, but to more accurately, *access it*. I will also mention here as I introduce these ideas that they are both ancient in nature and already possible to varying degrees. 

While focused on the merger between the spiritual and technological Worlds, I do not necessarily mind whether it be me or my generation to engineer such things, but I believe these will constitute the greatest revolutions in the following millennia, so we need to be considering the foundations , motivations and use cases in order that we can defend against the disbalances in the hierarchical organism that we call Gaia. 

We are representatives and the luminary future will have at its disposal a crossroads between universal enlightenment and enslavement. This dark age does not need to occur, so it is an obligation that we lay the applications and concepts that will usher in something more approximating utopia than hell.

### **Psychogravitronics, Oneironautics and Synergistic Intuitives**

What is the vision here?

The end result would be a merger of the tripartite systems beginning with the organic and allowing an access into the preparatory corridors of superluminal experience. There are potentially infinite artifacts in the superluminal realms and it is hopeful that there are higher forces at play which will manage any disputes on the organism level to ensure a synonym of peace. One consideration  is that we are not *yet* annihilated on the luminal (PRM - Physical Matter Reality - or *this* one) due to similar reasoning. 

A note on terminology: There are few assumptions that are taken into account in any valid scientific inquiry and the ones that we use here is the wisdom of Yogis, here represented as the individuals which have undergone the labor and wonder of exploring consciousness. In considering the developmental, modern man and woman is confined to the scarecrow model of reality - where every thought is premediated by an isolated acceptance of valuelessness. Drugs are seen as recreational tools and death is seen as final. Even in religious circles, more often than not dogma has calcified the introspection of Being such that spiritual direction towards an internal exploration is viscerally amputated. Dreams are byproducts of cognitive labor and the assets by which life are defined culminate in a simulacrum of externalization from internal process. 

On the other end are accounts from the psychonauts among us, the shamans and yogis mentating an epic, illustrating infinite lands of dazzling perplexity and in their wisdom tell none of it to the western philosophers. 

The tales of gods and creatures hiding in the labyrinths of such innerverses implores modern man to consider the cause and effect able to validate such claims, that if only we ran with such ideas what would we be able to recognize within ourselves, infinity? Divinity even? 

The Oneironautic realm is one of obvious illusivity and it seems that Humans ebb and flow in their approach to the (et)internal realms. Most of us, as I mentioned before, do not even believe that there are such things, let alone prepare to engage with them. We should spend the valuable effort to ask ourselves why, but on the other hand ask ourselves what can be accomplished in both the process of preparation as well as the consequences of engagement. 

We can begin by breaking down the innerverse and outerverse into separate domains of representation, with outer space and stellar travel on the one side and psychonautic / oneironautic on the other. Both sides validate their own infinities, so accessing the complete taxonomies of either are not within the scope of Human motivation, even though we may see it as desirable. When we break it open this way we can get a general sense of the scope exploring what access we have and at current what the Human is denied in understanding. 

As a disclaimer, I apologize that my visualizations have to be hand drawn, I don’t have the resources to spend the time developing beautiful animations (get me a coffee if you would like to see them )

Alternatively, the scope of individuals can be connected in waking worldline, so any device that affects the victim will have to accurately account for collateral psychic paralysis. 

Currently the interest is in Amygdalate EMD (electromagnetic distortion) and how this corresponds to complete body (potentially *chakra*) polarity. Essentially Human memory can be anticipated and affected externally if the voltage of the victim matches. This can be easily tested, but the reach is to see whether affecting the body voltage (such as a 180 degree shift mentioned as indicative of a phase-shift by certain authors), can offer a natural method to circumvent external provocation.

Technology can seemingly be disrupted by the valence measures of certain metallurgic components as well, correspondingly indicative of the electron potential or even infrasonic lanes. I am suggesting that the government may be working on technology that affects your cognitive states and that certain metals can deflect or enhance this (talk about a tin foil hat), and the last point is that infrasonic frequencies are highly associated with the phenomenon  in general and therefore require their entirely separate gambit of testing.  

A useful map would be to account for the full host of what we know about concept patternization at all - and construct out of them amplification categories that give us as researchers a useful architecture of frequency distribution that can be mapped to concepts which we would like to amplify or quiet. In a way we need a dictionary of thinking. The beauty is that at bare minimum this gives us a view into the accesses and affordances of the mind as a meditator; such as how phase transitions can take place without anything other than a frequency tunneling technique which can be most immediately applied to dream lucidity. 

Sometimes as I write, I ask myself how I got here. And then I wonder how realistic many of these things can or might be, then I remember that we first dream the possible before it becomes reality.  

Happy researching.
