Philosophers have typically imposed a tripartite division on the types of memory: habit memory, personal memory, and factual memory. Habit memory is memory for the sort of everyday procedures one experiences and carries out; an example would be “remembering” how to get home from school. Personal memory is memory for events that one has personally experienced; an example would be one’s witnessing the fall of the Berlin Wall. Finally, factual memory is memory for facts; an example would be remembering that 2 + 2 = 4. For our purposes we will covey the concept of memory as an output for the distributed internal systems of the Human brain on 2 levels - the physiological or neuronal and the paraluminary, of which the former we will discuss today. Then we will ask ourselves some pretty interesting questions as to how psychofactoring - or external manipulation of cognitive processes can occur. 

Today we will go over the role of CA1 hippocampal neurons, the role of fluorescent proteins in erasing memories and dive into the future with questions such as how mental correspondence has been affected by the Highers and how some future technologies such as sentient lasers can replace prescription pharmacology or invasive dilatory practices.

Just prior to the staging of the this website, I had the opportunity to interview Albert. A wine worker in Northern Italy who described his experience where his memory was wiped by a gaseous, pulsating blue orb above the factory. When Albert took to record the luminary object, a faint light was projected towards him, temporarily paralyzing him. After the ordeal, Albert had no recollection of the events for the following 8 months. 

Interestingly enough, In the early 20th century Richard Semons laid the groundwork for a theoretical proposal of memory which centered around the *engram*. This was a suggestion that neurons followed an inheritance of acquired characteristics and passed on information of an experience.

A century later this school of organic memory was overshadowed by advances in genetics and furthermore the technology of the 21st has allowed this experiential encoding of sense information and its distribution of future memory to be [physically seen](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=engram+&btnG=). 

This basis cements memory as a neurological process that can be observed and likely within this century will be exploited. Our process here is to outline the conceptual counterpart to the mathematical foundations that will one day give rise to technologies which can delete and implant new memories. A process that we have to seriously consider why and how is already being used. Most of our considerations for today will be focused on the Hippocampus, with the neuronal clusters of CA1 considered. 

**The hippocampus** is a complex and intrinsically vulnerable embedded system through which many of the common psychological disorders are pathologized. The common importance attributes are learning regulation, memory encoding and consolidation as well as spatial navigation.

The hippocampal formation is broken down into the dentate gyrus, CA3, CA2, CA1, subiculum and the entorhinal cortex. Historically, axonal and dendritic arbors perennially have been central to the experimental identification of neurons, as they underlie network connectivity and profoundly influence information processing.

For those of you interested CA stands for *Cornu ammonis,* coming from the old to mid-ancient Egyptian diety *Amun* (written *imn*) meaning something like "the hidden one" or "invisible" and was one of the eight primordial deities. 

**Researchers have recently attempted an abridgement of the autonoetic, using photoreactive plasmids to test the validity and specifications of Semons theory.** Many of these [plasmids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid) encode for [microbial opsins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opsin), which are membrane channels and pores derived from algae and [archaebacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea). Keep this in mind for later, as our reliance on exobiological life to explore the Human innerverse will translate well to adaptable methods. 

Lets say that the experiment goes something like this: You grab a couple of c-Fos modified mice, condition them to an external stimulus such as a bell with a negative stimuli such as a shock and observe the position of the engram when the bell is present but not the shock. You can even go so far as to ablate or cut the diphtheria toxin receptor to reverse the fear response. 

In a nutshell the researchers were able to administer a “false memory”.

By quantifying the levels of c-Fos (basically a healthy gene found in  a cell) in the basolateral amygdala during a false memory we can compare the correlation to external stimulus as compared to a neutral stimulus. 

In humans, memory distortion and illusions occur frequently. These phenomena often result from the incorporation of misinformation into memory from external sources as well as narrative amplification that supports ontological architypes. Cognitive studies in humans have reported robust activity in the hippocampus during the recall of both false and genuine memories so we consider on the one hand the neurological building blocks and the other the symposium that connects the spirit realm to the PMR machine known as the brain.  

> *The researchers were able to see the dynamic interaction between the false and genuine memories at different stages of the memory process. During the acquisition phase, the artificial contextual information ( by light activation) either competed with the genuine contextual cues (natural exposure) for the valence of the US (foot shock), or may have interfered with the perception of the genuine contextual cues.*
> 

This resulted in reduced expression of both false and genuine fear memories compared with the strength of recall attainable after normal fear conditioning. This could also be related to the overshadowing effects for multiple CSs. During the recall phase, the false memory and the genuine memory were either additive or competitive.

**So lets pause for a minute and go over what all of this means → essentially these researchers were able to simulate a fear response without a genuine external stimulus which was observed in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, signifying the representation of a false memory.** 

The second paper involves more detailed and up to date work on the subject. These researchers were able to isolate complexes of excitations that represent tangible unified engram-complexes (UECs) with the hope to delete them. They were successful and thus ushers in the era of dominance over memories. 

This engram complex is considered to be interchangeable with a memory trace and focused on the second criterion of the theoretical engram, which is synaptic strength between co-active neurons, also known as associative plasticity.

Using *post-hoc* immunohistochemistry or *in situ* hybridization to label the engram in brain sections, studies from the amygdala, hippocampus, and cortex have reliably visualized a sparse population of neurons that reactivated at a greater-than-chance level upon re-exposure to the environment previously experienced. In a nutshell the researchers believe that since they can now witness the memory, they can delete or alter it utilizing light.

The most convincing evidence, however, comes from studies leveraging IEG expression to genetically tag and/or modulate neurons within the hippocampal engram. These studies demonstrate that silencing a subset of the hippocampal engram (loss-of-function studies) impairs fear memory recall. 

HERE 

Although advantageous to the memory index theory,The Cognitive Map Theory, however, does not fully explain some of the most important aspects of episodic memory attributed to the CA1, such as temporal association (the binding of discontinuous elements of an experience in time)

...

There seems to be a faily substantial subcategorization that happens to encode memories that can take place on a more lets say spiritual level. In future episodes I will cover the likelihood of nonlocal perception acting in time on the subneural constellations

Some of the exceptional websites mentioned today that we will be returning to include the elifesciences portal for the hippocampus. 

### **Potential Future Considerations**

We already know what happens to a civilization studying gain-of-function research in the dark recesses of economics and medicine; three years, billions of dollars and millions of lives later, we are still dealing with the catastrophic consequences of an engineered pandemic. 

 

This kind of research has to be considered within the scope of potential weaponology and therefore we need to consider some of these paths which it can be weaponized in order to best prepare against it. 

Innovation is a beautiful thing, but understanding the intrinsic workings of the mind and body are complicated enough to grant room for constant improvement. Since we are moving farther away from agreement and cooperation, here are a few considerations for those of us wanting to prepare for a millennium with this novel technology. 

**Light**

The photoreactive aspect of the research asserts that so far as the mind is positioned externally, there are imitations to freedom of choice when even light can contain sabotaging agents like the air contains viruses. More research needs to be done in the Infraspectric and Ultraspectric as we contain the spectrum of light between 10^3 - 10^-12.

In many ways the evidence points to light as being the source of future technological manipulation as well, citing the example from my interview above. 

A few possibilities are proposed in order of increasing difficulty.

1. Lasers will house intelligent agent manipulators within their already propagating wave states. 
2. Humans have not identified the wave states that can accurately psychofactor. 
3. Light is a secondary consequence not of lasers, but a completely separate consciousness agent that regards unknown physics.

### The Theory of Bystander Observance

Within this framework, an alternative path is achieved by microscopically observing and influencing the engram cascade from nanobot or quantum embodiment scales. Any sufficiently advanced intelligence can achieve this and the question really seems to me whether an advanced civilization would automate the conscious multiplier equalivent into superintelligences in the quantum world for this purpose. Suppose the analogy is an advanced computer / camera that is made of quantum fluff and can achieve the same input as a billion meditators attempting an astral projection together. Now **that** is recon.
