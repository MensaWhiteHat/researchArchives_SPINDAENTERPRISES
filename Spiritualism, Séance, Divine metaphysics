# Spiritualism, Séance, Divine metaphysics

*Research*

**Spiritualism** is a [movement] based on the belief that the spirits of the dead exist and have the ability and the necessary means to communicate with the living. Seances are the attempt to make contact with these entities. 

Spiritualism has two primary postulations : the first is that there exists a spirit world where the dead go, and that these spirits are more advanced than human beings. Out of these two emerges a consequence of communication that believes there are truths or wisdom to be learned from these spirits. 

[Spiritism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritism), a branch of spiritualism developed by [Allan Kardec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Kardec) and today practiced mostly in [Continental Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Europe)
 and [Latin America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America)
, especially in [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil)
, emphasizes [reincarnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation).

At its height, the movement had around 8 million followers, many of which were wealthy. The numbers dwindled due to the fraud practices of many mediums.

They believe that anyone can become a medium through practice and formal communucation with the spirits happens through séances.

*Considerations*

- There is contradition with the modern mythological accounts of the greys as cogently morpho-ontical (all beings of emergent experience are the same whether good or bad)and the erception of spiritually advancing beings
- Current exo-mythological and astro-archiological estimations posit that “those with matter, matter.” Insinuating that the current Higher consciousness integrations are failing in majority of cases to be materializable as they act for sake of human proximity.
