### Welcome here, enclosed you will find independent research regarding the ‚Äúlocations‚Äù of consciousness from waking alertness (PMR¬π) to TAO (Totality). I compile this information from research in fields such as psychoanalysis, meditation, altered states, near death experiences, the occult, mythology, religious studies, hypnosis, phenomenology and much, much more. My aim is to study these dimensions as tangible artifacts for Humans to interact, with wide-ranging consequences for understanding our multiverse and our place within it. If you would like to see where these ideas can take us, click [here](https://www.notion.so/Advanced-Projects-0bc6c931bf6a40898c1c52de2ac35cf3).

A perceptual template believed to arrange the aggregate of temporal space which can easily be seen upon closing one's eyes. The Spindle Background is a registrar of cognition as represented in frequency, thereby devoid of color and sense. Considered the omnipervasive element substructuring the alert-level delta and the Primary Constellation (described in further reading)  the SB is accessible always yet often imperceptible for its seeming lack of animation. Meditative states and frequency tunneling techniques have shown to rupture the seismography of the SB and carry the agent into deeper states of awareness known as the Focus States. 

The SB is thought to emerge as a failsafe for metaconceptual modeling and in most cases a nondiscriminatory element to facilitate easy entry into the hypnogogic states. Little is known as to the operational pattern that connects the agent to the SB, but physiologically the emergence is predicated by phosphene persistence following world-plane connection.

The current scientific suggestion is widely held that the spindle background is simply what you see as the [darkness behind your eyes](https://scienceline.org/2014/12/why-do-we-see-colors-with-our-eyes-closed/). [Nothing more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphene#Mechanism).

As with most of the information included, developments in our research will redefine the process of dream induction. We are soon going to publish the data supporting the hypothesis that projectors experience illusions as a sort of ‚Äúdream training ground‚Äù known in first part by the contemporary literature as hypnagogia - or **the transitional state of consciousness between wakefulness and sleep.** However close this definition will be, it is insufficient to explain what it even means to ‚Äútransition.‚Äù We refer here to the meta qualities of the so called Physical Matter Reality (PMR) and introduce a second stage of the hypnogogic state as well as undermine our colloquial usage of the word *transition*. 

First, PMR is supported by the entirety of philosophical literature - from Aristotle to Descartes; in other words that there is a physical reality that exists and importantly that this reality exists *separate* from us. This not only presupposed that an ontological agent - or you - *sees* these ‚Äúthings‚Äù that have no causal or retrocausal status until we interact with it; only then do we have a relationship. A problem with this position is all too apparent when you introduce a modular element of reality which has been teased as esoteric, religious or superstitious : namely that consciousness casts a much larger net than we initially thought. Consider the quality of the research which accounts for remote conscious perception and time influence, some even predicting the future with a strangely asymmetric similarity (perhaps you see all the numbers of the lottery in your sleep, wake and play only to find you missed the last number. ) In either case this demonstrates that kernelized consciousness (mentioned later) stands as a bridge in time, contorting certain memories to be highly vivid, seeing parallel timelines in dreams and witnessing future events in a way demonstrative of presentience. 

Now, PMR is important because it provides the artifacts of this plane for usage in the training-ground-levels-of-consciousness and also validates that transition either never really occurs or is always happening depending on which definition of the word you take. 

This then leads the primary hypnogogic stage to be a release of this viewport within awareness and hand off to the other developed space that you inhabit. *You* here is meaning a cobular clusters of consciousness, one handing off to the next during its respective time. A third, hegemonic awareness can be formed out of the two with persistent memory of each one.

The second stage is a test for whether of not the identities are working together - a ‚Äúconscious-subconscious‚Äù handoff, which ends with the qualitative memory being extended to encompass part of the dream generation phase. Memory can of course be lost or stolen from you (or placed back in its respective spot) so some methods to improve this memory would be more robust protocols to enter such as resonance tuning or frequent reality checks.

Consciousness isn't a thing. It might be, but that is like saying that we might be a thing. 

It is more probably like a map. Like a space. Like a topographical *entity*,  you and I as a  series of nodal points, existing at any given time like magazines in a room. Okay, maybe more like fuzz on a carpet. I'm not good at the metaphors, but you get the idea - anywhere we want to travel to within our universe already exists within our mind. A bold statement to be sure, and there are many difficulties with the process; yet this suggests that, much like a skill, the process can be refined and improved.

Don't believe me? 

Good thing I'm not asking you to; simply check out any of the work by Dean Radin, Thomas Campbell or Joe McMonigle. What is important for our position is to see what we can do with it. 

There are a lot of places within consciousness, and we can explore them forever - however I wanted to mention a few which seem to overarch and are repeatable. Where this collective space for exploration came from and what we are doing within it - I'm sure this answer will come. For now, let's take a look at some of the spaces that we can map.

Consciousness seems to immediately tied to the surroundings of time moreso than space. Take these observations.

*[Missing aspect]*

The start of our voyage begins with the initialized, immediately available *Alert-Level Delta, Primary Constellation.*

The *Delta*. Located in the Individuated Conscious *Constellation Primary (*below*).*

**This can be thought of** as your conscious awareness as you live your life routinely. This includes the states of automation, I(nhibited)-memory (memory as dependent on the individual experience) and all fundamental schematic layers which support your discretion and attention within waking life. Otherwise, your *automatic ontical.* 

**When you zoom out** on its relationship to the other mental structures, the location tends to affix itself to a grouping of causality - dendritically connected to previous frames with reciprocity to emergent phenomena. The constellation is named as *Primary*, for I have yet to find a layer discoverable prior to this in life development.

<aside>
üçØ *The Primary Constellation and its attributes*

</aside>

Being closest to Human individuation, the Primary constellation is arguably the most vulnerable topology within mental awareness. 

Physically, the constellation indexes reality according to one's ontology. This process is non-discriminatory meaning that for whatever lifeline is composed, reality will be sequestered so far as to self-refute any attempt to identify beyond the personality. For example I-memory, a crucial building block of this constellation, is composed more of interweaving narratives which shift through one's life as opposed to absolute experiences. Exaggerating circumstances can entrap a consciousness into this constellation and any one of the component onographies can consume or colonize the totality of the cluster. 

*Onographies within the Constellation : {I-memory, Flow State, Identity, Motivation, Discrimination, Ownership, Passive Loci Architecture}*

üçØ **SECOND LAYER CONSCIOUSNESS :**¬†*Kernelized Consciousness*/ *The Omega,  Integrated Constellation*

</aside>

Next we find ourselves to a reserved location within *The Total;* which I will be calling the *Kernel.* 

**The Kernel is a** non-iterative escape point for the Primary Constellation. What is in the former a vector for retrieval of control and autonomy, is here a position from which conceptual choice can take place. Here is the beginning of Intuition, the potential for Collectivity, and Parallel Atomization.

üçØ The Constellation  attributes

</aside>

This constellation is hierarchically tiered. Beginning with the representative atomic - you. It seems that the individual is schematically separated into a sea of competing echoes, for which some mechanism towards synergy defines ultimate thought and action.

**I can't outline a basic map of locations in and around consciousness** without at least an introduction to one of the more exotic spaces encountered.  The epicenter of all narratives and the storage for accessing collective knowledge is in a constellation-sized parallax - immense in size, housing all of Human experience within catacombs of language and intuitive access to all skillsets. It is seemingly the most difficult to reach by projectors and is likely separated on a planar distribution in order to evade erosion of intention. Expertise in any subject is tantamount to vibrational import from one avenue of this space and is secured there ‚Äúforever‚Äù.

**The Lucidity States** collect potentiation from the mental habituation one commands from life. Witnessing states of conscious change within the lucid are magnitudes more enticing than say smoking a joint or drinking ayahuasca. On the outskirts of the Astral, the Traverse Constellation occupies states of desire, amplifies your states of intention and redirects the unconscious to constructively challenge you. The Transverse seems to act like a filter for psychic passengers, and I wonder how higher entities cross, given the space is represented or mediated by how one handles conception in the Primary.
